# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file contains settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# 1. Site settings
#
# These are used to personalize your new site. In HTML or markdown files,
# these may be accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# Remember that Jekyll only processes files that have front matter! So if you
# want to use these variables in template expansions make sure your file has
# front matter. Empty front matter is sufficient to trigger processing.
#
# You can add any custom variable you wish, and it will be accessible
# in templates as {{ site.myvariable }}.

# 2. Collections
#
# A Jekyll collection is a set of files that use the same layout by
# default and can be iterated over. "posts" is the standard collection
# (of "blog posts"), and we also define "equipment" as our own
# collection.

collections:
  posts:
    title: Posts # Siteleaf apparently needs this
    output: true
    description: "Latest news from Adobe Creek" # The post list page content
    feature_text: |
      What's happening at Adobe Creek
    feature_image: "https://picsum.photos/2560/600?image=866"
  people:
    title: People
    ### output: true
    description: "People at Adobe Creek"


##############################
# 3. Settings for collections
#
# Each map in the defaults list has a key "scope" and a key "values".
# In the scope map, the "path" matches against each page's URL path
# (empty string matches all paths)
# and "type" matches against the name of the collection. For a page
# matched by the scope, each of the variables defined in the "values" map
# is given the value specified in the map.
#
# Again, these are defaults, used only if the variable isn't set in the
# front matter of the page.

defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
    values:
      image: "/assets/default-social-image.png" # Default image for sharing
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: post # Set the default layout for posts
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "pages"
    values:
      layout: page # Set the default layout for pages
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "people"
    values:
      layout: page # Set the default layout for people
