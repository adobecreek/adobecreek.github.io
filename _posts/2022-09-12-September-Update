So much for good intentions, my updates were definitely impacted by the summer vacation and changing job.
So what has happened?

## The Plow
Well back mid-July [South Branch](https://southbranch.net/) took delivery of the vibrating plow.

Daniel also created a [shared album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dQ5dmp7izRCkZH7k7) for photos and videos from the handover and training event. if (like me) you have no clue what a vibrating plow is, or how it works, check out the ![video here](/assets/IMG_4247 copy.mov) showing a little of its power 

## The City
We are making great progress with City of Palo Alto. We were going to present to the council but that was ==postponed until this month==.
The City of Palo Alto Utilities and the engineering departments are extremely positive of our initiative and as we progress they have a number of additional areas that they would support us as we extend our coverage.  
The City may not always be quick (ha) but at this time they are not slowing us down.

## the Installation
Unfortunately, the global supply chain issues continue to plague us.  Next Level Networks has done a great job of finding a source of microduct and the network vaults that we need. The availability of the Fibre is still a number of weeks away!

## The Timeline
At this stage we expect to have the materials and permits in ==November==.
The actual installation once materials have arrived is remarkably quick, and if we can stick to the ==November== start we would expect the service to be up and running by the ==end of the year==.
