Happy 4th July - another glorious day here on Page Mill Road.
I will be picking up the webmaster activities for Adobe Creek. Bear with me, that means I have to relearn.
My intent is to provide an update at least monthly. When we get closer to laying ductwork or installation, I will put my Jimmy Olsen hat on and get the camera out to document the journey as it goes into the ground.
